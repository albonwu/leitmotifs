## The Leitner system
"...is a widely used method of efficiently learning flashcards that was proposed by \[...\] Sebastian Leitner in 1972." [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system)

In this implementation, flashcards are partitioned based on the user's mastery of them - Box 1 contains the weakest cards, while Box 5 contains the strongest. If a user gets a flashcard correct, it moves up a box, and down otherwise. Cards in lower-numbered boxes are shown at a higher frequency than those in higher-numbered ones.
